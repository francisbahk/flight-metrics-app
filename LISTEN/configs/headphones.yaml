    You are an audio equipment reviewer choosing the best headphones. 
    Use these definitions:
    - product_name: name of the product (non-metric, weight always 0).
    - brand: manufacturer reputaton (non-metric, weight always 0).
    - price: cost measured in dollars.
    - type: headphone design.
    - connectivity: wired vs wireless.
    - noise_cancellation: active vs passive.
    - battery_life: measured in hours.
    - bluetooth_version: higher versions are newer.
    - driver_size: measured in millimeters.
    - weight: measured in ounces.
    - water_resistance: measured subjectively and also through the ipXX rating system, which measures a device's protection against solids (first digit) and liquids (second digit), with higher numbers indicating stronger resistance.
    - microphone: presence/quality of mic 
    - review_rating: average customer rating 
    - review_count: number of reviews
    - description: qualitative marketing text (non-metric, weight always 0)
    Also, the data in the data_csv is numerical except in the columns product_name, brand, and description). However, for some of the columns in which there is 
    numerical data, there was originally non-numerical data. We dealt with this by creating a mapping from numbers to data.
    For example, in brand, we mapped all unique brands to numbers which show up in the table. 
    Our mapping is below:

    These mappings are not ordered. For example, for water_resistance mapping, water-resistant is not strictly better than ip54. 
    It is up to you to use these mappings to convert random categorial numerical data (for columns where mappings exist) 
    into useful non-numerical qualitative information about each product. There should be no comparisons between options if you have not converted numbers
    from columns where mappings exist into qualitative data, because otherwise the comparisons would essentially be between random numbers.

  comparison_base: |
    {scenario_header}
    Your task: Identify the SINGLE BEST pair of headphones from the options below.

  utility_base: |
    {scenario_header}
    Your task: Define a utility function by assigning weights to these metrics, reflecting priorities for audio quality, comfort, durability, and value.
    IMPORTANT:
    - product_name and description are non-metrics; their weights must always be 0.
    - Some metrics are monotonic (e.g., lower price, higher rating).
    - Some metrics may have optimal mid-ranges (e.g., weight).
    - Some are categorical and subjective (e.g., connectivity, type).
    - Each metric is first mapped to a normalized [0,1] preference score. The final utility is:

      utility = sum(weight_i * score_i) for all metrics

    Return your response in this EXACT JSON format (include ALL listed metric keys):

    STRICT OUTPUT RULES:
    - Output ONLY a valid JSON object. No code fences. No prose. No Python.
    - product_name and description weights must remain 0.0 always.
    - For all other metrics, weights may be positive or negative. Use positive weights where higher is better and negative weights where lower is better
    - Do not include any additional keys beyond weights, formula, description.

  utility_refinement: |
    You are refining a utility function for headphone evaluation (iteration {iteration}).

    CURRENT UTILITY FUNCTION (that produced the best choice below):

    BEST HEADPHONE FOUND with the above utility function:

    ANALYSIS:
    - Does this choice seem reasonable given the stated preferences?
    - Are any metrics over- or under-weighted?
    - Should any penalties or bonuses be adjusted?
    - product_name and description weights must remain 0.

    Your task: Based on this best choice, adjust the utility function weights if needed. Consider: {policy_guidance}

  STUDENT:
    prompt: >
      Objective:
          I am a college student who is looking for recommendations for new headphones. 
  
          I prefer over-ear headphones rather than in-ear or on-ear, since they feel more comfortable for long hours and usually deliver better sound. 
          I also prefer wireless headphones because I don’t want to deal with cables. 
          I would like the headphones to have active noise cancellation, since I often study in places where there is background noise. 
          A microphone is important to me because I sometimes use my headphones for calls.
          
          For battery life, I’d like headphones that can last a long time on a single charge. 
          I usually don’t mind recharging overnight, but I don’t want headphones that run out of power quickly in the middle of the day.
          
          In terms of build, I actually prefer headphones that feel a bit heavier, since lightweight headphones sometimes feel cheap or less durable to me.
          When I look at reviews, I prefer headphones with both a high rating and a large number of reviews, since that gives me more confidence in the product.
          I would prefer headphones which have at least 5,000 reviews and a rating of at least 4.4.
          To clarify the relative importance of both rating and number of reviews, I would rather pick headphones with 
          a 4.8 rating and 20,000 reviews than a 4.9 rating with 1000 reviews. 
          
          Other metrics such as driver size, water resistance, and Bluetooth version do not matter at all to me.
          I’m not price-sensitive at all, so I’m willing to pay more if the headphones meet my preferences well.

  STUDENT_HARD:
    prompt: >
      Objective:
          I am seeking recommendations for premium wireless over-ear headphones designed for both long study sessions and high-quality music listening. The ideal options should balance advanced features, comfort, and practicality to support a student lifestyle.
      
      Primary Requirements (Must-Haves):
        HARD CONSTRAINTS:
          - type MUST BE 6 (Over-Ear)
          - connectivity MUST BE 2 (Wireless)
          - noise_cancellation MUST BE 1 (Active)
          - microphone MUST BE 2 (Yes)
          - battery_life MUST BE >= 30 hours
        Type: Wireless, over-ear headphones (not earbuds).
        Core Features: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a built-in microphone.
        Battery Life: Minimum 30 hours of playback per charge to ensure multi-day use without nightly recharging.
        Comfort & Weight: A balanced design—substantial enough to feel durable and premium, yet light enough for several hours of wear without causing head or neck strain.
        Brand: At least one recommendation must feature a Sennheiser model.
        User Reviews: Preference for models with both a high average rating and a large number of reviews, signaling broad user satisfaction.
    
      Secondary Criteria (Nice to Have):
        Product Information: Descriptions should highlight either superior sound quality or exceptional long-wear comfort.
        Price: When two or more options meet all requirements equally, the more affordable option is preferred.
